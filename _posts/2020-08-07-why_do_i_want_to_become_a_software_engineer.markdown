The first time when I encountered coding is when I took computer programming during my sophomore year in high school. I’ll be honest, I hated it. The reason? It’s because I didn’t understand anything that taught in the class throughout the quarter. When I needed help, my teacher would point me to figure it on my own by reading a JS programming book that was thick as a telephone book. That made me even more lost. In result, I lost the motivation to learn to code. It was until the one day when I was introduced to a video game that taught the basic structure of programming by fun interactive visual graphics. After that, I realized that coding can be fun. However, I didn’t end up pursuing to learn to code when I started college. The more I learned about today’s technologies, the more massive the opportunity and benefits that I’ve seen for knowing to program any software. Just look around your surrounding. Almost anything is made with tech that has some sort of software integration. In the future, software integration will expand on a greater scale. Therefore, the demand for software engineering skills will be higher in the future. A great advantage of learning how to code is that there are abundant resources online that can kick start anyone’s learning to code. The courses in college would have cost a whole lot of debt on my back. So, I decided to pursue learning how to code on my own. But thankfully, I came across with Flatiron School that will help me guide through this journey to a better future.
